# 1. Introduction to Visual Thinking

What is **Visual Thinking**?

> Visual Thinking is the ability that everyone has to connect ideas, emotions and senses at the same time through the drawing. Even before writing, humans developed drawing skills many years ago, because the act of drawing connects many things to understand the world behind us. Sometimes formal education prioritised other ways to communicate (writing, public speaking, etc.), and people used to think drawing it’s only a skill for artists. Visual Thinking  is this ability to communicate to each other through visuals.

The Chauvet caves in France the humans from more than 35 000 years ago drew the first drawings. We have the drawing skills in our genes!

Visual Thinking is the ability to connect with other parts of you and improve your way to understand the world behind you.

This ability as any other one, needs time and experience to improve. During this workshop you'll learn just the basics.

What can you learn and achieve using Visual Thinking in your day by day? Clarity and order. 

# 2. Part I: Build your iconography 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17634377/208791385-cf1936ba-cd50-4d8c-8d8c-1472086eeb57.png)

> It's important remark Visual Thinking has many levels of application. For this workshop we're waiting to show you how to develop the basic skills, during all the activites you'll draw and apply techniques to show you how to draw just for you, this is the basic level. When we think about drawing, we use to think in beautiful illustrations because we connect drawing with aesthetic images, but for us, we need practical drawings, significant sketches that allow you to connect ideas, even if the drawings are not the most beautiful. So don't worry about your drawing skills, this is the best space for practice.

Please read first the instructions and read the last point, follow the activity.

## Activity 1: Visualize flows

1. You're going to use two sheets.
2. Take one sheet and a marker (It doesn't matter which color).
3. Open the first video [Suite - Psicosis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU8qpU6m3Fk).
4. Close your eyes, while the video it's playing use your hand to start to write your sensations about the song. Feel free to use all the space available. 
5. Take the second sheet, and now open the second video [Bohemian Rapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=095xkqjGhsY).
6. Again, close your eyes, and while the video it's playing, use your hand to write your sensations about the song.

Examples:

<details>
  <summary> After finish the activity </summary>
  
  ## Resume 
  > What do you feel about drawing your sensations about this songs? The first one it's a famous song from Psicosis, a popular film, while the second song it's more emotive and happy. What are the diffence between both exercises?
  
  Takeaways 🏆:
  - For this activity you should close your eyes, because you need to work with your other senses like the active listening and the drawing by your hands. 
  - The scribbles are just a visualization of how you're feeling the music. Music allow us to connect better with emotions. We need to develop this connection.
  - What about practice this during a meeting? Could you visualize your emotions?

## Activity 2: Build iconography 

1. Open the following app that help us to choose a random letter [Letter Picker Wheel](https://pickerwheel.com/tools/random-letter-generator/).
2. Take another sheet for this exercise. 
3. Choose a random letter.
4. In 3 minutes draw all the words starting with the letter selected. You have to draw many drawings as you can, they don't have to be perfect. 
5. Repeat this 3 times. 

Example:

<details>
  <summary> After finish the activity </summary>
  
  ## Resume 
  > Visual Thinking it's practical, so we need to develop this skill and this activity it's about that. Although the first part is about think in all the words with the letter, the hard part comes when you have to draw that words, but in that short time you should be able to start to connect quickly meanings with drawings, that's the skill that we need! I recommend you practice this many times as possible.  
  
  Takeaways 🏆:
  - How easy or hard it's drawing practical icons? Sometimes it's hard find references about icons, I recomment you find your words here: [Flaticon Icons](https://www.flaticon.es/)
  - Using timers involve another kind of complexity, but we're learninig and we need this just to show to us how we're working in a short period of time. This could give us better metrics about our progress. 
  - Remember, we need easy and practical drawings to represent words.

## Activity 3: Build your visual dictionary

1. Take a sheet for this exercise.
2. Try to draw your own version of the following image.
3. Save this sheet as your visual dictionary.

# 5. Why to develop your Visual Thinking?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17634377/208791685-6276b99f-63a8-40c7-9902-e3e42c12b011.png)

Visual Thinking help us to build visual tools to improve our understanding capabilities and communication skills. All of this activities were designed to show you how to start to develop this skill for you, but it's just the beginning. 

The most basic level of Visual Thinking is make conscious about your mental process to understand, order and structure knowledge. You need to be provided of a set of drawings skills to generate your own sketches. This level is not about drawing beautiful illustrations for others, it's about drawing symbolic sketches to help you to boots your understanding. 

The first part was about create a relationship between you and the drawing through simple exercises to visualize music, create icons and visuals. The second part was about develop your active listening, because in Visual Thinking we need all your senses working at the same time. The last part it's a summarize of all the previous activities step by step, creating a visual interpretation is what a graphic recording is. All the previous techniques are just tools that you can learn and improve to use together at the same time for any propose. 

Visual Thinking is a skill to connect with you. You need to be sincere and honest with your processes, and work from there to improve it. Visual Thinking could boots any other kind of knowledge, and it's a great combination in technology environments. 

Some ideas about where to apply this techniques:

- Create visual summaries in meetings.
- Product discovery processes, you can document all the flows about this.
- Information flows, you can sketch entities and information exchange to clarify flows.
- Graphic Recordings in conferences.
- Sketch software components.
- Create presentation skeletons.
- Complement documentation with visual summaries.

Congratulations! Thanks for follow this workshop, I hope teach you something new and interesting and see you soon in another workshop.

Remember this are a set of techniques that needs time and a lot of practice. Be patient, specially with the drawing most of the people think that they need to draw beautiful illustrations, we're using the drawing as an skill to connect with ourselfs and with other ones, we don't need the most beautiful content because the most important part it's the content by itself. We're learning how to visualize our internal processes (emotional and mental). We're learning how to connect from other parts. Interesnting isn't it?

Keep drawing and tag me on social medio to see your progress! See you! 😊
